# RuleLoE
Rule LoE is a decision rule learning system. It is part of the LoE (League of Experts) framework. The main idea is to learn a set of rules which can be used to explain the predictions of a model. The rules are learned in a way that they are as simple as possible, but as complex as necessary. The system is meant to be used in the context of explainable AI (xAI).
